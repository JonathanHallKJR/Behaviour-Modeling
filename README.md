# Behaviour-Modeling

A set of script to support the generation of behaviour graphs from Gherkin feature files, along with a limited set of model maintenance operations (merge, promote to background, etc).

Works with Flying Logic.

May support other visualisation libraries in future (e.g. open source DOT graph format)
